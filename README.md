#  Rails Lite

A project in understanding the rails framework, REST request lifecycle, MVC abstractions (ORM models, Controllers, View templating) and metaprogramming (route generations).

## Usage...if you insist
Clone the repo and run `ruby  bin/bonus_server.rb`
Your routes are defined in `lib/finalized/routes.rb`
There is no separate folder for loading controller or model class files into yet, you'll have to smash them into the bonus server like the examples
Views are in `views` and you have access to the cookie through session (persisted) and flash (both flash and flash.now work)
